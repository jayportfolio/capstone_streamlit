# Benchmarking my model using cloud services

## Benchmarking my model using AWS services


I attempted to run my models against the AWS services.

### AWS Sagemaker

I found the setup to be both confusing and unexpectedly expensive, and the teardown process to avoid costs unnecessarily obstructive and opaque.
I have ultimately decided against visiting AWS again until I am further along in my Machine Learning journey, since there are other options available at zero-low cost, and with a far easier learning ramp-up time.


##  Benchmarking my model using Gradient Cloud Services

I have used Paperspace Gradient to benchmark my model. It is possible to set up their compute power easy and straightforwardly, and I was able to successfully run my notebooks, and train and save my models via the service.
