# Deploying my Capstone

I will be deploying my project as a webapp.

I will use the Streamlit framework to create a webapp which will take input about the features of a London property, apply those features to my pre-trained model, and display on screen for the user the predicted price of the property.


Where the input data being used is an instance from the test data set, the webapp will also display the actual price of the property, so the user can see how successful the model is at predicting property prices.
